                            As the end of the year is approaching, it is also a busy day for people to remove old
                            clothes
                            and replace many old things. The big cleaning can not only give the home a new look but also
                            the
                            refreshing space has a sense of tranquility and comfort. According to a Japanese organizing
                            guru
                            Marie Kondo, she emphasizes that "the ultimate goal of organizing is to learn to appreciate
                            everything you have."<br><br>

                            Kondo Marie shares that when cleaning or tidying up, "we should not focus on what to clear,
                            but
                            think about what to preserve and what should really be left. If people can appreciate what
                            they
                            have instead of always thinking about buying other items constantly, they will find that
                            many
                            things are actually unnecessary.‚Äù<br><br>

                            She mentions that sometimes people often think, "why don't you put things when there is
                            space?"
                            In fact, this concept is wrong, because using the environment efficiently will make people
                            feel
                            more refreshed.<br><br>

                            Below are the KonMari Method in 5 Steps:<br><br>


                            <strong>Step 1: Think about your needs</strong><br>
                            Whenever helping people with housework, Kondo Marie must first ask the other person "what
                            kind
                            of life do you want?" Many people may be able to say it right away, but some people actually
                            don't know what they want. However, this is exactly Marie Kondo wants people to think about
                            what
                            they really need, so that they can tell the difference between what they want and what they
                            don't.<br><br>

                            <strong>Step 2: Take out all similar items</strong><br>
                            The key to Marie's tidying magic is that tidying is not carried out on a room-by-room basis,
                            but
                            on a category-by-item basis, such as clothes, books, tableware, etc. For example, take out
                            all
                            the clothes and pile them up into a small mountain, and you will know how many clothes you
                            have.
                            "When organizing, we should organize according to the type of items, not the location."
                            Kondo
                            Marie said that there are five major categories of storage, namely "clothes", "books",
                            "paper",
                            "small things and sundries". " and "Emotional Items".<br><br>

                            <strong>Step 3: Choose the object that is exciting</strong><br>
                            With the process of step 1, facing the mountain of items piled up in step 2, you can choose
                            the
                            items that make your heart beat.<br><br>

                            <strong>Step 4: Thank and Discar</strong><br>
                            Keep what you love and be grateful for what you discard. Why give thanks for what is already
                            about to be thrown away? Marie actually hopes that everyone will always take care of their
                            own
                            intention during the storage process. Desired items should be kept continuously, because it
                            is
                            necessary to create future life and life attitude; and the reason why people are reluctant
                            to
                            throw away items or feel tired of throwing things is actually because they do not realize
                            that
                            there must be a consciousness of "separating" from items, that is, the process of convincing
                            yourself to "discard".
                            Therefore, Marie Kondo will lead people to express gratitude for the items that will be
                            discarded. She even knelt in the middle of the room and expressed her gratitude for
                            everything
                            and the house itself. People have to remind themselves of the relationship they have already
                            formed with their surroundings, so that they can cut it off and move on when
                            necessary.<br><br>

                            <strong>Step 5: Give your favorite item a home</strong><br>
                            Since the items left behind make your heart move, it means that it has a certain status in
                            your
                            heart, so it should be properly stored and given a certain amount of respect. For example,
                            it
                            should not be randomly stacked and thrown away, or even put into a garbage bag. Treat the
                            items
                            that make your heart casually, and the next time you see it, you will lose the feeling of
                            heart,
                            and the life you want to create will not come.
